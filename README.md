A number of useful functions for analysing cosmological simulations. The code is designed to be agnostic to which 
particular simulation is being analysed by allowing the user to specify their own reading routine in the format shown in 
`simtools/sim_readers.py`.

See `example_script.py` for a minimal example function to use simtools.
